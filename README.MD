**MERN STACK**

- Front end made with react using a sci-fi theme UI framework arwes
- REST API made whit NODE , using express framework

###Install

- you can install client and server with a simple `npm install` on the root folder (the one containing client and server folders)

###Dev mode

- `npm start` can run the dev mode on the react and node just have in mind that sometimes this script doesnÂ´t work well on windows, for that case I recommend to start each client and server separately
